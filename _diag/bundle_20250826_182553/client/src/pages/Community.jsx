      Loventia is a space to meet new people in a safe and respectful way. To
      keep the community healthy, we ask everyone to follow these basic rules.
    </p>

    <div className="space-y-4">
      <section>
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">1. Respect Others</h2>
        <p>
          Treat all members with kindness and respect. Hate speech,
          discrimination, or harassment will not be tolerated.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">2. Be Honest</h2>
        <p>
          Use real information and be truthful about who you are. Fake profiles
          or misleading details harm trust in the community.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">3. Stay Safe</h2>
        <p>
          Do not share sensitive personal information publicly. Report suspicious
          behavior to keep the community safe.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">4. No Spam</h2>
        <p>
          Avoid posting irrelevant links, ads, or repetitive content. Use
          Loventia only for genuine connections.
