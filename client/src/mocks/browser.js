  Mock Service Worker (MSW) setup in development.

// --- REPLACE START: remove top-level await; keep test stub & lazy load ---
/**
 * Goals:
 *  - In tests: do NOT import 'msw/browser' (prevents network/timeouts in CI).
 *    Export a lightweight stub with the same surface used by the app.
 *  - In non-test envs: lazy-import MSW and handlers without top-level await,
 *    so production build works with esbuild targets that disallow it.
 *  - Do NOT auto-start here; the app decides when to call worker.start().
