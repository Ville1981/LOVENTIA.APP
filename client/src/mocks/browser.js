  Mock Service Worker (MSW) setup in development.

// --- REPLACE START: import setupWorker from 'msw/browser' (not 'msw') ---
import { setupWorker } from 'msw/browser';
// --- REPLACE END ---

// --- REPLACE START: import your handlers ---
import { handlers } from './handlers';
// --- REPLACE END ---

// Create the service worker with provided request handlers
export const worker = setupWorker(...handlers);

// --- REPLACE START: do NOT auto-start here; main entry controls .start() ---
/*
  Important:
  - Call worker.start() manually from your main.jsx/main.tsx if you want MSW active in dev.
  - This avoids running MSW unintentionally in production builds.
